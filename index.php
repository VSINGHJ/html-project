        <h2><center>The TR-1 Regency Radio</center></h2>
        <p>Welcome to the Transistor Radio Shop, where we celebrate the history and importance of these iconic media devices. The pocket size of transistor radios sparked a change in popular music listening habits, allowing people to listen to music anywhere they went before the internet. The Regency TR-1 was released in 1954 becoming the first commercial transistor radio. The Regency TR-1 circuitry was refined from the Texas Instruments drawings, reducing the number of parts, including two expensive transistors.</p>

        <p>Welcome to the Transistor Radio Shop, where we celebrate the history and importance of these iconic media devices. A foxhole radio is a makeshift radio that was built by soldiers in World War II for entertainment, to listen to local radio stations using amplitude modulation. The foxhole radio was a crude crystal radio which used a safety razor blade as a radio wave detector with the blade acting as the crystal, and a wire, or, later, a graphite pencil lead serving as the cat's whisker.</p>

        <p>Welcome to the Transistor Radio Shop, where we celebrate the history and importance of these iconic media devices. A Bakelite radio is a vintage radio crafted from Bakelite molded plastic. These 1930s-era radios were known for their distinguishable Art Deco look. Bakelite was the worldâ€™s first synthetic plastic, patented in 1909 and very popular until the middle of the 20th century. Other plastics began to gain popularity in the late 1940s, but the retro appeal of bakelite objects makes them very collectable today.</p>
